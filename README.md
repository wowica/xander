[![Version](https://img.shields.io/hexpm/v/xander.svg)](https://hex.pm/packages/xander)

Elixir client for Cardano's Ouroboros networking protocol. This library can be used to build Elixir applications that connect to a Cardano node using the Node-to-Client protocol.

‚ö†Ô∏è This project is under active development. See [Xogmios](https://github.com/wowica/xogmios) for a more stable solution to connect to a Cardano node through [Ogmios](https://ogmios.dev/).

## Mini-Protocols currently supported by this library:

- [x] Tx Submission
- [x] Local State Query
  - get_epoch_number
  - get_current_era
  - get_current_block_height
  - get_current_tip
- [ ] Chain-Sync

## Quickstart

Below is an example of how to connect to a Cardano node and run a query that returns the current tip of the ledger, similar to a `cardano-cli query tip` command.

```elixir
$ iex
> Mix.install([{:xander, "~> 0.1.0"}])
> # Must be a valid Unix socket path
> # to a fully synced Cardano node
> socket_path = "/path/to/cardano-node.socket"
> config = Xander.Config.default_config!(socket_path)
[
  network: :mainnet,
  path: [socket_path: "/tmp/cardano-node.socket"],
  port: 0,
  type: :socket
]
> {:ok, pid} = Xander.Query.start_link(config)
{:ok, #PID<0.207.0>}
> Xander.Query.run(pid, :get_current_tip)
{:ok,
 {147911158, "b2a4f78539559866281d6089143fa4c99db90b7efc4cf7787777f927967f0c8a"}}
```

  <summary><i>Running Queries via Docker</i></summary>

  ## Running Queries via Docker

  In order to run queries via Docker, you need to build the image first:

  ```
  docker build -t xander .
  ```

  With the image built, you can now connect to either a local Cardano node via a UNIX socket or to a node at Demeter.run.

  #### 1. Connecting via a local UNIX socket

  This assumes you have access to a fully synced Cardano node.

  üö® **Note:** Socket files mapped via socat/ssh tunnels **DO NOT WORK** when using containers on OS X.

  Run the previously built Docker image with the `-v` argument, which mounts the path of your local socket path to 
  the container's default socket path (`/tmp/cardano-node.socket`):

  ```
  docker run --rm \
    -v /your/local/node.socket:/tmp/cardano-node.socket \
    xander elixir run_queries.exs
  ```

  #### 2. Connecting to a node at Demeter.run

  The demo application can connect to a Cardano node at [Demeter.run](https://demeter.run/) ü™Ñ 

  First, create a Node on Demeter and grab the Node's URL.

  Then, run the Docker image with the `DEMETER_URL` environment variable set to your Node's URL:

  ```bash
  docker run --rm \
    -e DEMETER_URL=https://your-node-at.demeter.run \
    xander elixir run_with_demeter.exs
  ```

  <summary><i>Running Queries with native Elixir install</i></summary>
  
  ## Running Queries with native Elixir install

  For those with Elixir already installed, simply run the commands below:

  ```
  # Must set a local unix socket
  elixir run_queries.exs

  # Must set a Demeter URL
  elixir run_queries_with_demeter.exs
  ```

  More information on connection below:

  #### a) Connecting via local UNIX socket

  Run the following command using your own Cardano node's socket path:

  ```bash
  CARDANO_NODE_PATH=/your/cardano/node.socket elixir run_queries.exs
  ```

  ##### Setting up Unix socket mapping (optional when no direct access to Cardano node)

  This is useful if you want to run the application on a server different from your Cardano node.

  üö® **Note:** Socket files mapped via socat/ssh tunnels **DO NOT WORK** when using containers on OS X.

  1. Run socat on the remote server with the following command:

  ```bash
  socat TCP-LISTEN:3002,reuseaddr,fork UNIX-CONNECT:/home/cardano_node/socket/node.socket
  ```

  2. Run socat on the local machine with the following command:

  ```bash
  socat UNIX-LISTEN:/tmp/cardano_node.socket,reuseaddr,fork TCP:localhost:3002
  ```

  3. Start an SSH tunnel from the local machine to the remote server with the following command:

  ```bash
  ssh -N -L 3002:localhost:3002 user@remote-server-ip
  ```

  4. Run the example script:

  ```bash
  CARDANO_NODE_PATH=/tmp/cardano_node.socket elixir run.exs
  ```

  #### b) Connecting via Demeter.run

  To connect to a node at Demeter.run, set `DEMETER_URL` to your Node Demeter URL.

  ```bash
  DEMETER_URL=https://your-node-at.demeter.run elixir run_with_demeter.exs
  ```

  <summary><i>Submitting Transactions</i></summary>

  ## Submitting Transactions

  ‚ö†Ô∏è This project does not provide off-chain transaction functionality such as building and signing of transactions.

  In order to submit transactions via Xander, you can either run the `submit_tx.exs` script directly or use Docker. 


  ## Running the script

  This assumes you have Elixir installed. In order to run the script directly, follow the steps below:

  1. Get ahold of the CBOR hex of a valid signed transaction (not covered by this library)
  2. Populate the environment variable `CARDANO_NODE_SOCKET_PATH` with a socket file for a fully synced Cardano node.
  3. Ensure the `Config.default_config!` function call matches the network being used:
    - `Config.default_config!(socket_path)` defaults to Mainnet
    - `Config.default_config!(socket_path, :preview)` for Preview network
  4. Run `elixir submit_tx.exs <transaction-CBOR-hex>` providing the CBOR hex as its single argument.

  A successful submission should return the transaction ID. This ID can be used to check the status of the transaction on any Cardano blockchain explorer.

  ## Using Docker

  This assumes you have Docker installed. No Elixir installation is required.

  1. First, build the image:

  ```
  docker build -t xander .
  ```

  2. Ensure the `Config.default_config!` function inside the `submit_tx.exs` file matches the network being used:  
    - `Config.default_config!(socket_path)` defaults to Mainnet  
    - `Config.default_config!(socket_path, :preview)` for Preview network

  3. Get ahold of the CBOR hex of a valid signed transaction (not covered by this library)

  Run the previously built Docker image with the `-v` argument, which mounts the path of your local socket path to 
  the container's default socket path (`/tmp/cardano-node-preview.socket`):

  ```
  docker run --rm \
  -v /your/local/preview-node.socket:/tmp/cardano-node-preview.socket \
  xander elixir submit_tx.exs <transaction-CBOR-hex>
  ```

  A successful submission should return the transaction ID. This ID can be used to check the status of the transaction on any Cardano blockchain explorer.
